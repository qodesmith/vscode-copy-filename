# vscode-copy-filename

_Project originally cloned from [Brad Zacher](https://github.com/bradzacher/vscode-copy-filename)._

This extension adds the following:

1. File Explorer right click menu items which allow you to copy one (or more) filenames with (or without) the extension:

   ![copy from explorer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qodesmith/vscode-copy-filename/main/copy-from-explorer.jpg)

1. Editor title right click menu items which allow you to copy the filename with (or without) the extension:

   ![copy from tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qodesmith/vscode-copy-filename/main/copy-from-tab.jpg)

1. Command pallette commands so you can access single-file commands quickly, or assign keyboard shortcuts to them:

   ![copy command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qodesmith/vscode-copy-filename/main/copy-command.jpg)
